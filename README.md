# WaterBillingSystem

Developed a simple billing system with a GUI to calculate water bills. Upon entering the meter number, user (water board employee) retrieves customer data such as consumed units, contact information, and outstanding amounts. The system displays over due bills. The system then calculates the final bill based on this data.
